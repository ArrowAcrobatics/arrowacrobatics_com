## Teaching 
This year has been challenging for the arts. Sharing our passion on stage is simply irresponsible in this pandemic 
and I worry that the physical arts in particular will be among the industries taking the biggest hits.
To ensure that when this all is over we come out stronger than ever, I have increased the time I spend teaching.

## Handstands
I am available for private classes and small groups up to 5 people to teach handstands. It is my belief that in bigger
settings there is not enough room to work on all the details, adapt cues and exercises to the differences in bodies that 
are necessary to develop a strong, beautiful and healthy handstand.

## Aerial Rope & Silks
I love the thrill of release-catch tricks and that certainly shows in my workshops aerial rope and aerial silks. Whether you
are looking for a playful introduction to swinging, or want to get into finer details, I can create customized workshops for 
you or your community. In the end, it is not our skill level or physical attributes, but the joy of flying high that
connects us.
