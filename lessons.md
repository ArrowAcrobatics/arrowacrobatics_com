## Teaching 
This year has been challenging for the arts. Sharing our passion on stage is simply irresponsible in this pandemic 
and I worry that the physical arts in particular will be among the industries taking the biggest hits.
To ensure that when this all is over we come out stronger than ever, I have increased the time I spend teaching.

### Handstands
I am available for private classes and small groups up to 5 people to teach handstands. It is my belief that in bigger
settings there is not enough room to work on all the details, adapt cues and exercises to the differences in bodies that 
are necessary to develop a strong, beautiful and healthy handstand.

### Aerial Rope & Silks
Workshops (dynamic) aerial rope and aerial silks.
