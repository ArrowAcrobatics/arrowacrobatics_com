## Synopsis
The song Enormous Penis from Da Vinci's Notebook gloryfies the well endowed male. 
Although initially joining the laughter, Johnny finds himself entangled in the driving 
force behind the song: toxic masculinity. A male aerialist is often expected to perform 
a shirtless act containing a series of strength tricks, especially on aerial straps. 
After literally casting aside his huge penis, he leaves the strength vocabulary behind 
by stripping down to his lace undershirt. Liberated by his high heels he celebrates 
his often hidden feminine side.
