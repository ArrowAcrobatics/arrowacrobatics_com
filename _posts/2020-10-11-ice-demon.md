## Synopsis
In this three part act, a demonic looking character seems to be threatened by an invisible, dark power. Shortly after awakening
he finds his own hands choking himself to death. In what follows he resurrects only to be confronted with the same situation.
Each resurrection gives him better odds in this battle, culmination into a high altitude confrontation on Aerial Rope.
